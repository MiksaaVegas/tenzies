# Tenzies game
An interesting minigame I made to practice my React skills. The idea comes from [freeCodeCamp's React Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMknfKXIFA8&t). The initial release is the same app from the course, just the code logic is mine. Any further releases are featuring my own features.
